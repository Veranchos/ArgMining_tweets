## Data 
[Data](data) directory contains:
- [Train](data/train) and [test](data/test/smm4h) data for SMM4H 2022 Task 2: tweets annotated for stance and premise prediction on three claims about COVID-19 mandates such as stay-at-home-orders, school closures, and face masks
- [2070](data/test/vaccine_tweets) annotated tweets about vaccine mandates, that were not used in the official SMM4H competition
- [600](data/test/vaccine_tweets/unused) annotated tweets about vaccine mandates with low inter-annotators agreement.

  The dataset is also available at ðŸ¤—[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/veranchos/arg_mining_tweets).

## Models
Models that were used in comparison can be found in [models](models/) directory:
- [ROBERTA](models/ROBERTA_baseline)
- [COVID-Twitter-BERT](models/CT-Bert)
- [DAN-BERT](models/DAN-Bert)

This competition was held within the framework of the SMM4H 2022 shared tasks. During the competition, the participants were offered two subtasks: stance detection and premise classification. We present a manually annotated corpus containing 6,156 short posts from Twitter on three topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic: school closures, stay-at-home orders, and wearing masks. We hope the prepared dataset will support further research on argument mining in the health field.",
